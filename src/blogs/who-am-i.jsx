        Hello, I am Shadow, and now I will tell you why I am building
        Shadowspace. It's not like this is the next big thing; I am starting
        Shadowspace as a personal hobby to test my skills as a software
        developer. But for now, whatever tool or service I use, I am going to
        make it within Shadowspace. I know, why build when someone already did
        it for you? But I don't want to lock myself into their environment. Of
        course, some things will be next to impossible as of now, but I will try
        to solve as many problems as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        My initial steps to make Shadowspace will be to create it as a blog
        website where I, or anyone, can share their thoughts, ideas, news, and
        experiences, gradually adding new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of my skill level, I only know React in a good, if not proficient
        way. But I will make the site in React with only client components, and
        all the initial blogs will be hardcoded. Gradually, I will add a
        database and automatic fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have recently bought a second domain, "iamshadow.xyz," after
        "shadowspace.xyz" from GoDaddy, and I am planning to document this
        journey on my portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>I will write more blogs as I add more featuresâ€¦</p>
